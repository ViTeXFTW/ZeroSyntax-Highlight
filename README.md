# ZeroSyntax-Highlight
<img src="./resources/ZeroSyntaxLogo.png" width="250"/>


## Introduction
**ZeroHour-Highlight** is a simple syntax highlighter for map.ini files in Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour. This project aims to provide a simple and easy syntax highlighting to help find errors, structure and understand the map.ini file.
The project will firstly focus on supporting map.ini files which works in the basegame (not modded). With this said, the highligher have mostly been tested in Zero Hour, but should work in vanilla (none zero hour).
